# Hackers Damage File System Challenge

In a world where information is power, a hacker known as _Savipo Yatar_ discovers a series of files on a highly protected server.

These files contain secrets that could change the course of history. But there's a problem: some of the files are fake, designed to deceive intruders. _Savipo Yatar_ must quickly determine which files are real and which are fake.

Each file has a name with two parts, separated by a hyphen (-). The first part is an alphanumeric string, and the second is achecksum, which is a string formed by the characters that only appear once in the first part and in the order in which they appear.

Write a program that determines whether a file is real or fake based on these rules.

Examples:

```
    File name: xyzz33-xy
    Result: ✅ Real (The checksum is valid)
    File name: abcca1-ab1
    Result: ❌ Fake (The checksum should be b1, it's incorrect)
    File name: abbc11-ca
    Result: ❌ Fake (The checksum should be ac, the order is incorrect)
```

Each line indicates the file name and its corresponding checksum, separated by a hyphen (-).

## How to solve it

1. Analyze the list of file names and their checksums that you will find in this file [files_quarantine.txt](./files_quarantine.txt)

2. Look for the real file number 33 (of all the real files, the 33rd in order of appearance) and submit its checksum with submit. For example, if the file is xyzz33-xy, you would do: `submit xy`
