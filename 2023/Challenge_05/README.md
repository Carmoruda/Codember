# The Final Problem

Finally, hackers have managed to access the database and have corrupted it. But it seems they have left a hidden message in the database. Can you find it?

Our database is in .csv format. The columns are _id_,_username_,_email_,_age_,_location_.

A user is only valid if:
- **id**: exists and is alphanumeric
- **username**: exists and is alphanumeric
- **email**: exists and is valid (follows the pattern user@domain.com)
- **age**: is optional but if it appears it is a number
- **location**: is optional but if it appears it is a text string

Examples:

```
Entry: 1a421fa,alex,alex9@gmail.com,18,Barcelona
Result: ✅ Valid

Entry: 9412p_m,maria,mb@hotmail.com,22,CDMX
Result: ❌ Invalid (id is not alphanumeric, the _ is extra)

Entry: 494ee0,madeval,mdv@twitch.tv,,
Result: ✅ Valid (age and location are optional)
Entry: 494ee0,madeval,twitch.tv,22,Montevideo
Result: ❌ Invalid (email is not valid)
```

## How to Solve It

1. Analyze the list of database entries and detect the invalid ones: [database_attacked.txt](./database_attacked.txt)

2. Find the first letter of the username of all invalid users. Gather them in the order of appearance and uncover the hidden message. Then send it with submit. For example:
`submit att4ck`
